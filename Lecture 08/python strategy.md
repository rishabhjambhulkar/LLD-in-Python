Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs make a **working example in Python** that you can copy-paste and run directly.

This uses the same **Robot Strategy Pattern**, but simplified for Python (without too much boilerplate like abstract base classes).

## üêç **Working Example**

```python
# --- Walking Strategies ---
class NormalWalk:
    def walk(self):
        print("Walking normally...")

class NoWalk:
    def walk(self):
        print("Cannot walk.")


# --- Talking Strategies ---
class NormalTalk:
    def talk(self):
        print("Talking normally...")

class NoTalk:
    def talk(self):
        print("Cannot talk.")


# --- Flying Strategies ---
class NormalFly:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying normally...")

class NoFly:
    def fly(self):
        print("Cannot fly.")


# --- Robot Base Class ---
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, walk_behavior, talk_behavior, fly_behavior):
        self.walk_behavior = walk_behavior
        self.talk_behavior = talk_behavior
        self.fly_behavior = fly_behavior

    def walk(self):
        self.walk_behavior.walk()

    def talk(self):
        self.talk_behavior.talk()

    def fly(self):
        self.fly_behavior.fly()

    def projection(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method.")


# --- Concrete Robots ---
class CompanionRobot(Robot):
    def projection(self):
        print("Displaying friendly companion features...")


class WorkerRobot(Robot):
    def projection(self):
        print("Displaying worker efficiency stats...")


# --- Main Demo ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Robot 1: Companion robot can walk & talk but not fly
    robot1 = CompanionRobot(NormalWalk(), NormalTalk(), NoFly())
    robot1.walk()
    robot1.talk()
    robot1.fly()
    robot1.projection()

    print("--------------------")

    # Robot 2: Worker robot can fly but not walk or talk
    robot2 = WorkerRobot(NoWalk(), NoTalk(), NormalFly())
    robot2.walk()
    robot2.talk()
    robot2.fly()
    robot2.projection()

    print("--------------------")

    # Changing behavior at runtime
    print("Updating Robot1 to learn flying...")
    robot1.fly_behavior = NormalFly()
    robot1.fly()
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Output when you run it**

```
Walking normally...
Talking normally...
Cannot fly.
Displaying friendly companion features...
--------------------
Cannot walk.
Cannot talk.
Flying normally...
Displaying worker efficiency stats...
--------------------
Updating Robot1 to learn flying...
Flying normally...
```

---

‚ö° This shows:

* Different robots can have **different combinations** of behaviors.
* You can **swap behaviors at runtime** (`robot1.fly_behavior = NormalFly()`).

---

Do you also want me to show you the **function-based Pythonic Strategy Pattern** (using plain functions instead of classes for behaviors)? That version is even shorter.
